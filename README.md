# multi_label_wine_quality_classification

This is a project in progress where I'm building a multi-label wine quality classifier with one vs. all method.

Some methods I applied include EDA (explorarotory analysis, data visualization), data preprocesssing (feature scaling, PCA), and different classfication models (logistic regression, SVM, K-means)
